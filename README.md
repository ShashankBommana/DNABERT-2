DNABERT-2 is a foundation model trained on large-scale multi-species genome that achieves the state-of-the-art performanan on 
 tasks of the GUE benchmark. It replaces k-mer tokenization with BPE, positional embedding with Attention with Linear Bias (ALiBi), and incorporate other techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of DNABERT.
